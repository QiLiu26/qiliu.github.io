               Global challenges such as climate change and artificial intelligence evolve rapidly, yet international organizations (IOs) respond unevenly. When do IOs adapt to new challenges, 
                and why do some expand while others do not? Although states design IOs to address specific cooperation problems, bureaucracies operationalize these mandates and can reshape what IOs do in practice. 
                I argue that IO bureaucrats are entrepreneurial but power-structured. They adapt selectively to global challenges in order to seek resources, attention, and recognition from the major principal state. 
                Through changing staff expertise and tasking, they change the scope of their IO to address issues prioritized by the major principal. Empirically, I introduce job postings as a new measure of IO operations 
                and compile an original dataset of 630,500 postings from 234 IOs (2007-2024). Using a difference-in-differences design exploiting the rising salience of climate and AI challenges, I show that IOs 
                expand their scope only when the major principal prioritizes the issue. When the major principal's priority shifts away, the IO contracts. The study reveals how state power in IOs shapes the global governance agenda.
